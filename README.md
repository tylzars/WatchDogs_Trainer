# WatchDogs_Trainer

This is my first trainer, some of the pieces may not work properly. Please use at your own risk! 

This was tested on v1.06.329 from Epic Games without the DLC but with the Living City 2.8 modpack.

Skill point and money work anytime but the Wanted Level seems to have different interactions when actually in an active chase. You should have the White Dots in the bar for the wanted level to be removed (or have escaped). I plan on figuring out the difference at some point so it'll work unanimously. 

Enjoy!
